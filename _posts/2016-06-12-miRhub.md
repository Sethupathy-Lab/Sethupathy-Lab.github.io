**miRhub** is intended to compute the predicted impact for each miRNA in a set (typically those highly expressed in a particular cell type) on a network of genes (typically those relevant to the study of a disease relevant to that cell type), and to predict candidate miRNAs that may act as regulatory hubs in that cell type for a particular disease or pathway.
