## miRquant

github: [miRquant](https://github.com/Sethupathy-Lab/miRquant)

**miRquant** is a pipeline developed in the Sethupathy lab for the analysis of small RNA sequencing.  miRquant calculates the reads per million mapped (RPM) for all small RNA species.  miRquant will identify which of the small RNAs correspond to miRNAs.

Many miRNAs are post-transcriptionally modified.  Accordingly, miRquant will identify which miRNAs undergo post-transcriptional editing and the type of edits which occur (3' additions, internal A-to-I, ect).
